	abstract = {Over the past decade, the spotted wing Drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, has invaded Europe and America and has become a major agricultural pest in these areas, thereby prompting intense research activities to better understand its biology. Two draft genome assemblies already exist for this species but contain pervasive assembly errors and are highly fragmented, which limits their values. Our purpose here was to improve the assembly of the D. suzukii genome and to annotate it in a way that facilitates comparisons with D. melanogaster. For this, we generated {PacBio} long-read sequencing data and assembled a novel, high-quality D. suzukii genome assembly. It is one of the largest Drosophila genomes, notably because of the expansion of its repeatome. We found that despite 16 rounds of full-sib crossings the D. suzukii strain that we sequenced has maintained high levels of polymorphism in some regions of its genome. As a consequence, the quality of the assembly of these regions was reduced. We explored possible origins of this high residual diversity, including the presence of structural variants and a possible heterogeneous admixture pattern of North American and Asian ancestry. Overall, our assembly and annotation constitute a high-quality genomic resource that can be used for both high-throughput sequencing approaches, as well as manipulative genetic technologies to study D. suzukii.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary origin of the striking genome size variations found in eukaryotes remains enigmatic. The effective size of populations, by controlling selection efficacy, is expected to be a key parameter underlying genome size evolution. However, this hypothesis has proved difficult to investigate using empirical data sets. Here, we tested this hypothesis using 22 de novo transcriptomes and low-coverage genomes of asellid isopods, which represent 11 independent habitat shifts from surface water to resource-poor groundwater. We show that these habitat shifts are associated with higher transcriptome-wide [Formula: see text] After ruling out the role of positive selection and pseudogenization, we show that these transcriptome-wide [Formula: see text] increases are the consequence of a reduction in selection efficacy imposed by the smaller effective population size of subterranean species. This reduction is paralleled by an important increase in genome size (25\% increase on average), an increase also confirmed in subterranean decapods and mollusks. We also control for an adaptive impact of genome size on life history traits but find no correlation between body size, or growth rate, and genome size. We show instead that the independent increases in genome size measured in subterranean isopods are the direct consequence of increasing invasion rates by repeat elements, which are less efficiently purged out by purifying selection. Contrary to selection efficacy, polymorphism is not correlated to genome size. We propose that recent demographic fluctuations and the difficulty of observing polymorphism variation in polymorphism-poor species can obfuscate the link between effective population size and genome size when polymorphism data are used alone.},

	abstract = {Genome architecture is profoundly influenced by transposable elements ({TEs}), and natural selection against their harmful effects is a critical factor limiting their spread. Genome defense by the {piRNA} silencing pathway also plays a crucial role in limiting {TE} proliferation. How these two forces jointly determine {TE} abundance is not well understood. To shed light on the nature of factors that predict {TE} success, we test three distinct hypotheses in the Drosophila genus. First, we determine whether {TE} abundance and relaxed genome-wide purifying selection on protein sequences are positively correlated. This serves to test the hypothesis that variation in {TE} abundance in the Drosophila genus can be explained by the strength of natural selection, relative to drift, acting in parallel against mildly deleterious non-synonymous mutations. Second, we test whether increasing {TE} abundance is correlated with an increased rate of amino-acid evolution in genes encoding the {piRNA} machinery, as might be predicted by an evolutionary arms race model. Third, we test whether increasing {TE} abundance is correlated with greater codon bias in genes of the {piRNA} machinery. This is predicted if increasing {TE} abundance selects for increased efficiency in the machinery of genome defense.},

	abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster has been a canonical model organism to study genetics, development, behavior, physiology, evolution, and population genetics for nearly a century. Despite this emphasis and the completion of its nuclear genome sequence, the timing of major speciation events leading to the origin of this fruit fly remain elusive because of the paucity of extensive fossil records and biogeographic data. Use of molecular clocks as an alternative has been fraught with non-clock-like accumulation of nucleotide and amino-acid substitutions. Here we present a novel methodology in which genomic mutation distances are used to overcome these limitations and to make use of all available gene sequence data for constructing a fruit fly molecular time scale. Our analysis of 2977 pairwise sequence comparisons from 176 nuclear genes reveals a long-term fruit fly mutation clock ticking at a rate of 11.1 mutations per kilobase pair per Myr. Genomic mutation clock-based timings of the landmark speciation events leading to the evolution of D. melanogaster show that it shared most recent common ancestry 5.4 {MYA} with D. simulans, 12.6 {MYA} with D. erecta+D. orena, 12.8 {MYA} with D. yakuba+D. teisseri, 35.6 {MYA} with the takahashii subgroup, 41.3 {MYA} with the montium subgroup, 44.2 {MYA} with the ananassae subgroup, 54.9 {MYA} with the obscura group, 62.2 {MYA} with the willistoni group, and 62.9 {MYA} with the subgenus Drosophila. These and other estimates are compatible with those known from limited biogeographic and fossil records. The inferred temporal pattern of fruit fly evolution shows correspondence with the cooling patterns of paleoclimate changes and habitat fragmentation in the Cenozoic.},

	abstract = {An absolute timescale for evolution is essential if we are to associate evolutionary phenomena, such as adaptation or speciation, with potential causes, such as geological activity or climatic change. Timescales in most phylogenetic studies use geologically dated fossils or phylogeographic events as calibration points, but more recently, it has also become possible to use experimentally derived estimates of the mutation rate as a proxy for substitution rates. The large radiation of drosophilid taxa endemic to the Hawaiian islands has provided multiple calibration points for the Drosophila phylogeny, thanks to the "conveyor belt" process by which this archipelago forms and is colonized by species. However, published date estimates for key nodes in the Drosophila phylogeny vary widely, and many are based on simplistic models of colonization and coalescence or on estimates of island age that are not current. In this study, we use new sequence data from seven species of Hawaiian Drosophila to examine a range of explicit coalescent models and estimate substitution rates. We use these rates, along with a published experimentally determined mutation rate, to date key events in drosophilid evolution. Surprisingly, our estimate for the date for the most recent common ancestor of the genus Drosophila based on mutation rate (25–40 Ma) is closer to being compatible with independent fossil-derived dates (20–50 Ma) than are most of the Hawaiian-calibration models and also has smaller uncertainty. We find that Hawaiian-calibrated dates are extremely sensitive to model choice and give rise to point estimates that range between 26 and 192 Ma, depending on the details of the model. Potential problems with the Hawaiian calibration may arise from systematic variation in the molecular clock due to the long generation time of Hawaiian Drosophila compared with other Drosophila and/or uncertainty in linking island formation dates with colonization dates. As either source of error will bias estimates of divergence time, we suggest mutation rate estimates be used until better models are available.},

There are two important pitfalls with this approach. Firstly, any premature stop codon impedes using such a strategy. Secondly, each sequence is translated with the same reading frame from beginning to end, so that the presence of a single additional nucleotide leads to both aberrant translation and alignment. We present an algorithm that has the same space and time complexity as the classical Needleman-Wunsch algorithm while accommodating sequencing errors and other biological deviations from the coding frame. The resulting pairwise coding sequence alignment method was extended to a multiple sequence alignment ({MSA}) algorithm implemented in a program called {MACSE} (Multiple Alignment of Coding {SEquences} accounting for frameshifts and stop codons). {MACSE} is the first automatic solution to align protein-coding gene datasets containing non-functional sequences (pseudogenes) without disrupting the underlying codon structure. It has also proved useful in detecting undocumented frameshifts in public database sequences and in aligning next-generation sequencing reads/contigs against a reference coding sequence. {MACSE} is distributed as an open-source java file executable with freely available source code and can be used via a web interface at: http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/macse.},

	abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile {HMMs}) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile {HMM} methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile {HMMs}, the “multiple segment Viterbi” ({MSV}) algorithm. The {MSV} algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. {MSV} scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an {MSV} score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile {HMM} Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call “sparse rescaling”. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring {MSV} hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full {HMM} Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available {HMMER}3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic {MSV} filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile {HMM} searches. {HMMER}3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than {HMMER}2. {HMMER}3 is now about as fast as {BLAST} for protein searches.},

Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find {ML} trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available {ML} programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same {CPU} time as {RAxML} and {PhyML}, then our software {IQ}-{TREE} found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the {IQ}-{TREE} stopping rule, {RAxML} and {PhyML} are faster in 75.7\% and 47.1\% of the {DNA} alignments and 42.2\% and 100\% of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with {IQ}-{TREE} improves to 73.3-97.1\%. {IQ}-{TREE} is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.},

	abstract = {The use of some multiple-sequence alignments in phylogenetic analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved, requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.},

	abstract = {The unequal utilization of synonymous codons affects numerous cellular processes including translation rates, protein folding and {mRNA} degradation. In order to understand the biological impact of variable codon usage bias ({CUB}) between genes and genomes, it is crucial to be able to accurately measure {CUB} for a given sequence. A large number of metrics have been developed for this purpose, but there is currently no way of systematically testing the accuracy of individual metrics or knowing whether metrics provide consistent results. This lack of standardization can result in false-positive and false-negative findings if underpowered or inaccurate metrics are applied as tools for discovery. Here, we show that the choice of {CUB} metric impacts both the significance and measured effect sizes in numerous empirical datasets, raising questions about the generality of findings in published research. To bring about standardization, we developed a novel method to create synthetic protein-coding {DNA} sequences according to different models of codon usage. We use these benchmark sequences to identify the most accurate and robust metrics with regard to sequence length, {GC} content and amino acid heterogeneity. Finally, we show how our benchmark can aid the development of new metrics by providing feedback on its performance compared to the state of the art.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Codon usage bias has been widely reported to correlate with {GC} composition. However, the quantitative relationship between codon usage bias and {GC} composition across species has not been reported.
{RESULTS}: Based on an informatics method ({SCUO}) we developed previously using Shannon informational theory and maximum entropy theory, we investigated the quantitative relationship between codon usage bias and {GC} composition. The regression based on 70 bacterial and 16 archaeal genomes showed that in bacteria, {SCUO} = -2.06 * {GC}3 + 2.05*({GC}3)2 + 0.65, r = 0.91, and that in archaea, {SCUO} = -1.79 * {GC}3 + 1.85*({GC}3)2 + 0.56, r = 0.89. We developed an analytical model to quantify synonymous codon usage bias by {GC} compositions based on {SCUO}. The parameters within this model were inferred by inspecting the relationship between codon usage bias and {GC} composition across 70 bacterial and 16 archaeal genomes. We further simplified this relationship using only {GC}3. This simple model was supported by computational simulation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The synonymous codon usage bias could be simply expressed as 1+ (p/2)log2(p/2) + ((1-p)/2)log2((l-p)/2), where p = {GC}3. The software we developed for measuring {SCUO} ({codonO}) is available at http://digbio.missouri.edu/{\textasciitilde}wanx/cu/{codonO}.},

	abstract = {Among vertebrates, most of the largest genomes are found within the salamanders, a clade of amphibians that includes 613 species. Salamander genome sizes range from ∼14 to ∼120 Gb. Because genome size is correlated with nucleus and cell sizes, as well as other traits, morphological evolution in salamanders has been profoundly affected by genomic gigantism. However, the molecular mechanisms driving genomic expansion in this clade remain largely unknown. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of transposable element ({TE}) content in salamanders. Using high-throughput sequencing, we generated genomic shotgun data for six species from the Plethodontidae, the largest family of salamanders. We then developed a pipeline to mine {TE} sequences from shotgun data in taxa with limited genomic resources, such as salamanders. Our summaries of overall {TE} abundance and diversity for each species demonstrate that {TEs} make up a substantial portion of salamander genomes, and that all of the major known types of {TEs} are represented in salamanders. The most abundant {TE} superfamilies found in the genomes of our six focal species are similar, despite substantial variation in genome size. However, our results demonstrate a major difference between salamanders and other vertebrates: salamander genomes contain much larger amounts of long terminal repeat ({LTR}) retrotransposons, primarily Ty3/gypsy elements. Thus, the extreme increase in genome size that occurred in salamanders was likely accompanied by a shift in {TE} landscape. These results suggest that increased proliferation of {LTR} retrotransposons was a major molecular mechanism contributing to genomic expansion in salamanders.},

This provides direct evidence for selection on silent sites in those three distantly related multicellular eukaryotes. Surprisingly, there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage and protein length. This effect is not due to a smaller size of highly expressed proteins. Thus, for a same-expression pattern, the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. This puzzling observation is not predicted by any of the current models of selection on codon usage and thus raises the question of how translation efficiency affects fitness in multicellular organisms.},

known methods and submodels. It employs a new way of modeling intron
lengths. We use a new donor splice site model, a new model for a
short region directly upstream of the donor splice site model that
takes the reading frame into account and apply a method that allows
better {GC}-content dependent parameter estimation. {AUGUSTUS} predicts
on longer sequences far more human and drosophila genes accurately

	abstract = {An accurate genome sequence of a desired species is now a pre-requisite for genome research. An important step in obtaining a high-quality genome sequence is to correctly assemble short reads into longer sequences accurately representing contiguous genomic regions. Current sequencing technologies continue to offer increases in throughput, and corresponding reductions in cost and time. Unfortunately, the benefit of obtaining a large number of reads is complicated by sequencing errors, with different biases being observed with each platform. Although software are available to assemble reads for each individual system, no procedure has been proposed for high-quality simultaneous assembly based on reads from a mix of different technologies. In this paper, we describe a parallel short-read assembler, called Ray, which has been developed to assemble reads obtained from a combination of sequencing platforms. We compared its performance to other assemblers on simulated and real datasets. We used a combination of Roche/454 and Illumina reads to assemble three different genomes. We showed that mixing sequencing technologies systematically reduces the number of contigs and the number of errors. Because of its open nature, this new tool will hopefully serve as a basis to develop an assembler that can be of universal utilization (availability: http://{deNovoAssembler}.sf.Net/).

	abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing allows us to sequence reads from a microbial environment using single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies. However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.Results: We introduce the {IDBA}-{UD} algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of {IDBA}-{UD} and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-{SC}, {SOAPdenovo} and Meta-{IDBA}) for different datasets, shows that {IDBA}-{UD} can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.Availability: The {IDBA}-{UD} toolkit is available at our website http://www.cs.hku.hk/{\textasciitilde}alse/idba\_udContact:chin@cs.hku.hk},

Thus far, however, such ancestral reconstructions have been done using simple linear regression approaches that do not account for phylogenetic inertia. These reconstructions could instead be seen as a genuine comparative regression problem, such as formalized by classical generalized least-square comparative methods, in which the trait of interest and the molecular predictor are represented as correlated Brownian characters coevolving along the phylogeny.Results: Here, a Bayesian sampler is introduced, representing an alternative and more efficient algorithmic solution to this comparative regression problem, compared with currently existing generalized least-square approaches. Technically, ancestral trait reconstruction based on a molecular predictor is shown to be formally equivalent to a phylogenetic Kalman filter problem, for which backward and forward recursions are developed and implemented in the context of a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. The comparative regression method results in more accurate reconstructions and a more faithful representation of uncertainty, compared with simple linear regression. Application to the reconstruction of the evolution of optimal growth temperature in Archaea, using {GC} composition in ribosomal {RNA} stems and amino acid composition of a sample of protein-coding genes, confirms previous findings, in particular, pointing to a hyperthermophilic ancestor for the kingdom.Availability and implementation: The program is freely available at www.phylobayes.org.Contact:nicolas.lartillot@univ-lyon1.{frSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In particular, for species with overlapping generations, it is easier to estimate the effective number of breeders in one reproductive cycle (Nb) than Ne per generation. We empirically evaluated the relationship between life history and ratios of Ne, Nb and adult census size (N) using a recently developed model (agene) and published vital rates for 63 iteroparous animals and plants. Nb/Ne varied a surprising sixfold across species and, contrary to expectations, Nb was larger than Ne in over half the species. Up to two-thirds of the variance in Nb/Ne and up to half the variance in Ne/N was explained by just two life-history traits (age at maturity and adult lifespan) that have long interested both ecologists and evolutionary biologists. These results provide novel insights into, and demonstrate a close general linkage between, demographic and evolutionary processes across diverse taxa. For the first time, our results also make it possible to interpret rapidly accumulating estimates of Nb in the context of the rich body of evolutionary theory based on Ne per generation.},

	abstract = {Background
Codon usage bias has been widely reported to correlate with {GC} composition. However, the quantitative relationship between codon usage bias and {GC} composition across species has not been reported.

Results
Based on an informatics method ({SCUO}) we developed previously using Shannon informational theory and maximum entropy theory, we investigated the quantitative relationship between codon usage bias and {GC} composition. The regression based on 70 bacterial and 16 archaeal genomes showed that in bacteria, {SCUO} = -2.06 * {GC}3 + 2.05*({GC}3)2 + 0.65, r = 0.91, and that in archaea, {SCUO} = -1.79 * {GC}3 + 1.85*({GC}3)2 + 0.56, r = 0.89. We developed an analytical model to quantify synonymous codon usage bias by {GC} compositions based on {SCUO}. The parameters within this model were inferred by inspecting the relationship between codon usage bias and {GC} composition across 70 bacterial and 16 archaeal genomes. We further simplified this relationship using only {GC}3. This simple model was supported by computational simulation.

Conclusions
The synonymous codon usage bias could be simply expressed as 1+ (p/2)log2(p/2) + ((1-p)/2)log2((l-p)/2), where p = {GC}3. The software we developed for measuring {SCUO} ({codonO}) is available at .},

	abstract = {Aging is a complex process affecting different species and individuals in different ways. Comparing genetic variation across species with their aging phenotypes will help understanding the molecular basis of aging and longevity. Although most studies on aging have so far focused on short-lived model organisms, recent comparisons of genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data across lineages with different lifespans are unveiling molecular signatures associated with longevity. Here, we examine the relationship between genomic variation and maximum lifespan across primate species. We used two different approaches. First, we searched for parallel amino-acid mutations that co-occur with increases in longevity across the primate linage. Twenty-five such amino-acid variants were identified, several of which have been previously reported by studies with different experimental setups and in different model organisms. The genes harboring these mutations are mainly enriched in functional categories such as wound healing, blood coagulation, and cardiovascular disorders. We demonstrate that these pathways are highly enriched for pleiotropic effects, as predicted by the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. A second approach was focused on changes in rates of protein evolution across the primate phylogeny. Using the phylogenetic generalized least squares, we show that some genes exhibit strong correlations between their evolutionary rates and longevity-associated traits. These include genes in the Sphingosine 1-phosphate pathway, {PI}3K signaling, and the Thrombin/protease-activated receptor pathway, among other cardiovascular processes. Together, these results shed light into human senescence patterns and underscore the power of comparative genomics to identify pathways related to aging and longevity.},

	doi = {10.1093/molbev/msq244},
	abstract = {The comparative approach is routinely used to test for possible correlations between phenotypic or life-history traits. To correct for phylogenetic inertia, the method of independent contrasts assumes that continuous characters evolve along the phylogeny according to a multivariate Brownian process. Brownian diffusion processes have also been used to describe time variations of the parameters of the substitution process, such as the rate of substitution or the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions. Here, we develop a probabilistic framework for testing the coupling between continuous characters and parameters of the molecular substitution process. Rates of substitution and continuous characters are jointly modeled as a multivariate Brownian diffusion process of unknown covariance matrix. The covariance matrix, the divergence times and the phylogenetic variations of substitution rates and continuous characters are all jointly estimated in a Bayesian Monte Carlo framework, imposing on the covariance matrix a prior conjugate to the Brownian process so as to achieve a greater computational efficiency. The coupling between rates and phenotypes is assessed by measuring the posterior probability of positive or negative covariances, whereas divergence dates and phenotypic variations are marginally reconstructed in the context of the joint analysis. As an illustration, we apply the model to a set of 410 mammalian cytochrome b sequences. We observe a negative correlation between the rate of substitution and mass and longevity, which was previously observed. We also find a positive correlation between ω = {dN}/{dS} and mass and longevity, which we interpret as an indirect effect of variations of effective population size, thus in partial agreement with the nearly neutral theory. The method can easily be extended to any parameter of the substitution process and to any continuous phenotypic or environmental character.},

	abstract = {Background: The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the efficacy of natural selection increases with the effective population size. This prediction has been verified by independent observations in diverse taxa, which show that life-history traits are strongly correlated with measures of the efficacy of selection, such as the {dN}/{dS} ratio. Surprisingly, avian taxa are an exception to this theory because correlations between life-history traits and {dN}/{dS} are apparently absent. Here we explore the role of {GC}-biased gene conversion on estimates of substitution rates as a potential driver of these unexpected observations.
Results: We analyze the relationship between {dN}/{dS} estimated from alignments of 47 avian genomes and several proxies for effective population size. To distinguish the impact of {GC}-biased gene conversion from selection, we use an approach that accounts for non-stationary base composition and estimate {dN}/{dS} separately for changes affected or unaffected by {GC}-biased gene conversion. This analysis shows that the impact of {GC}-biased gene conversion on substitution rates can explain the lack of correlations between life-history traits and {dN}/{dS}. Strong correlations between life-history traits and {dN}/{dS} are recovered after accounting for {GC}-biased gene conversion. The correlations are robust to variation in base composition and genomic location.
Conclusions: Our study shows that gene sequence evolution across a wide range of avian lineages meets the prediction of the nearly neutral theory, the efficacy of selection increases with effective population size. Moreover, our study illustrates that accounting for {GC}-biased gene conversion is important to correctly estimate the strength of selection.},

	abstract = {The anatomical basis and adaptive function of the expansion in primate brain size have long been studied; however, we are only beginning to understand the genetic basis of these evolutionary changes. Genes linked to human primary microcephaly have received much attention as they have accelerated evolutionary rates along lineages leading to humans. However, these studies focus narrowly on apes, and the link between microcephaly gene evolution and brain evolution is disputed. We analyzed the molecular evolution of four genes associated with microcephaly ({ASPM}, {CDK}5RAP2, {CENPJ}, {MCPH}1) across 21 species representing all major clades of anthropoid primates. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, positive selection was not limited to or intensified along the lineage leading to humans. In fact we show that all four loci were subject to positive selection across the anthropoid primate phylogeny. We developed clearly defined hypotheses to explicitly test if selection on these loci was associated with the evolution of brain size. We found positive relationships between both {CDK}5RAP2 and {ASPM} and neonatal brain mass and somewhat weaker relationships between these genes and adult brain size. In contrast, there is no evidence linking {CENPJ} and {MCPH}1 to brain size evolution. The stronger association of {ASPM} and {CDK}5RAP2 evolution with neonatal brain size than with adult brain size is consistent with these loci having a direct effect on prenatal neuronal proliferation. These results suggest that primate brain size may have at least a partially conserved genetic basis. Our results contradict a previous study that linked adaptive evolution of {ASPM} to changes in relative cortex size; however, our analysis indicates that this conclusion is not robust. Our finding that the coding regions of two widely expressed loci has experienced pervasive positive selection in relation to a complex, quantitative developmental phenotype provides a notable counterexample to the commonly asserted hypothesis that cis-regulatory regions play a dominant role in phenotypic evolution.},

	abstract = {The abundance, diversity, and genomic distribution of repetitive elements is highly variable among species. These patterns are thought to be driven in part by reproductive mode and the interaction of selection and recombination, and recombination rates typically vary by chromosomal position. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, repetitive elements are enriched at chromosome arms and depleted on centers, and this mirrors the chromosomal distributions of other genomic features such as recombination rate. How conserved is this genomic landscape of repeats, and what evolutionary forces maintain it? To address this, we compared the genomic organization of repetitive elements across ﬁve Caenorhabditis species with chromosome-level assemblies. As previously reported, repeat content is enriched on chromosome arms in most Caenorhabditis species, and no obvious patterns of repeat content associated with reproductive mode were observed. However, the ﬁg-associated C. inopinata has experienced repetitive element expansion and reveals no association of global repeat density with chromosome position. Patterns of repeat superfamily speciﬁc distributions reveal this global pattern is driven largely by a few repeat superfamilies that in C. inopinata have expanded in number and have weak associations with chromosome position. Additionally, 15\% of predicted protein-coding genes in C. inopinata align to transposon-related proteins. When these are excluded, C. inopinata has no enrichment of genes in chromosome centers, in contrast to its close relatives who all have such clusters. Forward evolutionary simulations reveal that chromosomal heterogeneity in recombination rate alone can generate structured repetitive genomic landscapes when insertions are weakly deleterious, whereas chromosomal heterogeneity in the ﬁtness effects of transposon insertion can promote such landscapes across a variety of evolutionary scenarios. Thus, patterns of gene density along chromosomes likely contribute to global repetitive landscapes in this group, although other historical or genomic factors are needed to explain the idiosyncrasy of genomic organization of various transposable element taxa within C. inopinata. Taken together, these results highlight the power of comparative genomics and evolutionary simulations in testing hypotheses regarding the causes of genome organization.},

Several chromosome-level genome assemblies exist for species within this group, but it has been a challenge to fully assemble the genome...The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the key model systems in biology, including possessing the first fully assembled animal genome. Whereas C. elegans is a self-reproducing hermaphrodite with fairly limited within-population variation, its relative C. remanei is an outcrossing species with much more extensive genetic variation, making it an ideal parallel model system for evolutionary genetic investigations. Here, we greatly improve on previous assemblies by generating a chromosome-level assembly of the entire C. remanei genome (124.8 Mb of total size) using long-read sequencing and chromatin conformation capture data. Like other fully assembled genomes in the genus, we find that the C. remanei genome displays a high degree of synteny with C. elegans despite multiple within-chromosome rearrangements. Both genomes have high gene density in central regions of chromosomes relative to chromosome ends and the opposite pattern for the accumulation of repetitive elements. C. elegans and C. remanei also show similar patterns of interchromosome interactions, with the central regions of chromosomes appearing to interact with one another more than the distal ends. The new C. remanei genome presented here greatly augments the use of the Caenorhabditis as a platform for comparative genomics and serves as a basis for molecular population genetics within this highly diverse species.},

More recent duplications of complete chromosome sets have been regarded as relatively unimportant in animal evolution. Polyploidy is often occurs only under remarkably uncommon circumstances among the metazoa and is therefore generate a curiosity than an evolutionary force in this group. The known cases of polyploid vertebrates and invertebrates are reviewed in succession, with notes about the phenotypic and evolutionary consequences interspersed throughout. It is known that polyploidy has arisen by a variety of mechanisms in a diverse array of animal taxa, covering approximately every major phylum. In part, the relatively low rate of discovery of polyploidy in animals reflects the low level of effort put into looking for it, which in turn is probably driven by the low expectation of success in finding it.

Phylogenetic methods have recently been incorporated to further disentangle this enigma, yet most of these studies have focused on widely diverged species. Few have compared patterns of genome size change in closely related species with known structural differences in the genome. As a consequence, the relationship between genome size and differences in chromosome number or inter-sexual differences attributed to {XY} systems are largely unstudied. We hypothesize that structural differences associated with chromosome number and X-Y chromosome differentiation, should result in differing rates and patterns of genome size change. In this study, we utilize the subgenera within the Drosophila to ask if patterns and rates of genome size change differ between closely related species with differences in chromosome numbers and states of the {XY} system. Genome sizes for males and females of 152 species are used to answer these questions (with 92 newly added or updated estimates). While we find no relationship between chromosome number and genome size or chromosome number and inter-sexual differences in genome size, we find evidence for differing patterns of genome size change between the subgenera, and increasing rates of change throughout time. Estimated shifts in rates of change in sex differences in genome size occur more often in Sophophora and correspond to known neo-sex events.},

Using complementary phylogenomic approaches, we identify widespread introgression across the evolutionary history of \textit{Drosophila}. Mapping gene-tree discordance onto the phylogeny revealed that both ancient and recent introgression has occurred, with introgression at the base of species radiations being particularly common.

Here, we characterized the {TE} content of the spotted wing fly Drosophila suzukii. Using a recently improved genome assembly, we reconstructed {TE} sequences de novo and found that {TEs} occupy 47\% of the genome and are mostly located in gene-poor regions. The majority of {TE} insertions segregate at low frequencies, indicating a recent and probably ongoing {TE} activity. To explore {TE} dynamics in the context of biological invasions, we studied the variation of {TE} abundance in genomic data from 16 invasive and six native populations of D. suzukii. We found a large increase of the {TE} load in invasive populations correlated with a reduced Watterson estimate of genetic diversity θw{\textasciicircum} a proxy of effective population size. We did not find any correlation between {TE} contents and bioclimatic variables, indicating a minor effect of environmentally induced {TE} activity. A genome-wide association study revealed that ca. 2,000 genomic regions are associated with {TE} abundance. We did not find, however, any evidence in such regions of an enrichment for genes known to interact with {TE} activity (e.g., transcription factor encoding genes or genes of the {piRNA} pathway). Finally, the study of {TE} insertion frequencies revealed 15 putatively adaptive {TE} insertions, six of them being likely associated with the recent invasion history of the species.},

	abstract = {The analysis of extant sequences shows that molecular evolution has been heterogeneous through time and among lineages. However, for a given sequence alignment, it is often difficult to uncover what factors caused this heterogeneity. In fact, identifying and characterizing heterogeneous patterns of molecular evolution along a phylogenetic tree is very challenging, for lack of appropriate methods. Users either have to a priori define groups of branches along which they believe molecular evolution has been similar or have to allow each branch to have its own pattern of molecular evolution. The first approach assumes prior knowledge that is seldom available, and the second requires estimating an unreasonably large number of parameters. Here we propose a convenient and reliable approach where branches get clustered by their pattern of molecular evolution alone, with no need for prior knowledge about the data set under study. Model selection is achieved in a statistical framework and therefore avoids overparameterization. We rely on substitution mapping for efficiency and present two clustering approaches, depending on whether or not we expect neighbouring branches to share more similar patterns of sequence evolution than distant branches. We validate our method on simulations and test it on four previously published data sets. We find that our method correctly groups branches sharing similar equilibrium {GC} contents in a data set of ribosomal {RNAs} and recovers expected footprints of selection through {dN}/{dS}. Importantly, it also uncovers a new pattern of relaxed selection in a phylogeny of Mantellid frogs, which we are able to correlate to life-history traits. This shows that our programs should be very useful to study patterns of molecular evolution and reveal new correlations between sequence and species evolution. Our programs can run on {DNA}, {RNA}, codon, or amino acid sequences with a large set of possible models of substitutions and are available at http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/forge/testnh.},

Given the trait observations at the tips of a phylogenetic tree, researchers are often interested where on the tree the trait changes its state and whether some changes are preferential in certain parts of the tree. In a model-based phylogenetic framework, such questions translate into characterizing probabilistic properties of evolutionary trajectories. Current methods of assessing these properties rely on computationally expensive simulations. In this paper, we present an efficient, simulation-free algorithm for computing two important and ubiquitous evolutionary trajectory properties. The first is the mean number of trait changes, where changes can be divided into classes of interest (e.g. synonymous/non-synonymous mutations). The mean evolutionary reward, accrued proportionally to the time a trait occupies each of its states, is the second property. To illustrate the usefulness of our results, we first employ our simulation-free stochastic mapping to execute a posterior predictive test of correlation between two evolutionary traits. We conclude by mapping synonymous and non-synonymous mutations onto branches of an {HIV} intrahost phylogenetic tree and comparing selection pressure on terminal and internal tree branches.},

In particular, the ratio {dNdS} is expected to be a good proxy for ω, the ratio of fixation probabilities of nonsynonymous mutations relative to that of neutral mutations. Standard methods for estimating {dN}, {dS}, or ω rely on the assumption that the base composition of sequences is at the equilibrium of the evolutionary process. In many clades, this assumption of stationarity is in fact incorrect, and we show here through simulations and analyses of empirical data that nonstationarity biases the estimate of {dN}, {dS}, and ω. We show that the bias in the estimate of ω can be fixed by explicitly taking into consideration nonstationarity in the modeling of codon evolution, in a maximum likelihood framework. Moreover, we propose an exact method for estimating {dN} and {dS} on branches, based on stochastic mapping, that can take into account nonstationarity. This method can be directly applied to any kind of codon evolution model, as long as neutrality is clearly parameterized.},

Here, we experimentally determined two key climatic niche traits (desiccation and cold resistance) for 92–95 Drosophila species and assessed their importance for geographic distributions, while controlling for acclimation, phylogeny, and spatial autocorrelation. Employing an array of phylogenetic analyses, we documented moderate-to-strong phylogenetic signal in both desiccation and cold resistance. Desiccation and cold resistance were clearly linked to species distributions because significant associations between traits and climatic variables persisted even after controlling for phylogeny. We used different methods to untangle whether phylogenetic signal reflected phylogenetically related species adapted to similar environments or alternatively phylogenetic inertia. For desiccation resistance, weak phylogenetic inertia was detected; ancestral trait reconstruction, however, revealed a deep divergence that could be traced back to the genus level. Despite drosophilids’ high evolutionary potential related to short generation times and high population sizes, cold resistance was found to have a moderate-to-high level of phylogenetic inertia, suggesting that evolutionary responses are likely to be slow. Together these findings suggest species distributions are governed by evolutionarily conservative climate responses, with limited scope for rapid adaptive responses to future climate change.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Mutation-selection phylogenetic codon models are grounded on population genetics first principles and represent a principled approach for investigating the intricate interplay between mutation, selection and drift. In their current form, mutation-selection codon models are entirely characterized by the collection of site-specific amino-acid fitness profiles. However, thus far, they have relied on the assumption of a constant genetic drift, translating into a unique effective population size (\textit{N}$_{\textrm{e}}$) across the phylogeny, clearly an unreasonable hypothesis. This assumption can be alleviated by introducing variation in \textit{N}$_{\textrm{e}}$ between lineages. In addition to \textit{N}$_{\textrm{e}}$, the mutation rate (\textit{μ}) is susceptible to vary between lineages, and both should co-vary with life-history traits ({LHTs}). This suggests that the model should more globally account for the joint evolutionary process followed by all of these lineage-specific variables (\textit{N}$_{\textrm{e}}$, \textit{μ}, and {LHTs}). In this direction, we introduce an extended mutation-selection model jointly reconstructing in a Bayesian Monte Carlo framework the fitness landscape across sites and long-term trends in \textit{N}$_{\textrm{e}}$, \textit{μ} and {LHTs} along the phylogeny, from an alignment of {DNA} coding sequences and a matrix of observed {LHTs} in extant species. The model was tested against simulated data and applied to empirical data in mammals, isopods and primates. The reconstructed history of \textit{N}$_{\textrm{e}}$ in these groups appears to correlate with {LHTs} or ecological variables in a way that suggests that the reconstruction is reasonable, at least in its global trends. On the other hand, the range of variation in Ne inferred across species is surprisingly narrow. This last point suggests that some of the assumptions of the model, in particular concerning the assumed absence of epistatic interactions between sites, are potentially problematic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The second force, deletion of {TE} {DNA}, is capable of removing vast swaths of genomic regions via recombinational processes, but we still have very little insight into how deletion varies across species and even among {TE} types.

	abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing allows us to sequence reads from a microbial environment using single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies. However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.Results: We introduce the {IDBA}-{UD} algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of {IDBA}-{UD} and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-{SC}, {SOAPdenovo} and Meta-{IDBA}) for different datasets, shows that {IDBA}-{UD} can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.Availability: The {IDBA}-{UD} toolkit is available at our website http://www.cs.hku.hk/{\textasciitilde}alse/idba\_udContact:chin@cs.hku.hk},

{RESULTS}: Our {RepeatScout} algorithm is more sensitive and is orders of magnitude faster than {RECON}, the dominant tool for de novo repeat family identification in newly sequenced genomes. Using {RepeatScout}, we estimate that approximately 2\% of the human genome and 4\% of mouse and rat genomes consist of previously unannotated repetitive sequence.

Surprisingly, the spread of repressive epigenetic marks (histone H3K9me2) to nearby {DNA} occurs at {\textgreater}50\% of euchromatic {TEs}, and can extend up to 20 kb. This results in differential epigenetic states of genic alleles and, in turn, selection against {TEs}. Interestingly, the lower {TE} content in D. simulans compared to D. melanogaster correlates with stronger epigenetic effects of {TEs} and higher levels of host genetic factors known to promote epigenetic silencing.

	abstract = {Transposable elements ({TEs}) are selfish {DNA} sequences that multiply within host genomes. They are present in most species investigated so far at varying degrees of abundance and sequence diversity. The {TE} composition may not only vary between but also within species and could have important biological implications. Variation in prevalence among populations may for example indicate a recent {TE} invasion, whereas sequence variation could indicate the presence of hyperactive or inactive forms. Gaining unbiased estimates of {TE} composition is thus vital for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of transposons. To this end, we developed {DeviaTE}, a tool to analyse and visualize {TE} abundance using Illumina or Sanger sequencing reads. Our tool requires sequencing reads of one or more samples (tissue, individual or population) and consensus sequences of {TEs}. It generates a table and a visual representation of {TE} composition. This allows for an intuitive assessment of coverage, sequence divergence, segregating {SNPs} and indels, as well as the presence of internal and terminal deletions. By contrasting the coverage between {TEs} and single copy genes, {DeviaTE} derives unbiased estimates of {TE} abundance. We show that naive approaches, which do not consider regions spanned by internal deletions, may substantially underestimate {TE} abundance. Using published data we demonstrate that {DeviaTE} can be used to study the {TE} composition within samples, identify clinal variation in {TEs}, compare {TE} diversity among species, and monitor {TE} invasions. Finally we present careful validations with publicly available and simulated data. {DeviaTE} is implemented in Python and distributed under the {GPLv}3 (https://github.com/W-L/{deviaTE}).},

	abstract = {The Drosophila genus is a unique group containing a wide range of species that occupy diverse ecosystems. In addition to the most widely studied species, Drosophila melanogaster, many other members in this genus also possess a well-developed set of genetic tools. Indeed, high-quality genomes exist for several species within the genus, facilitating studies of the function and evolution of cis-regulatory regions and proteins by allowing comparisons across at least 50 million years of evolution. Yet, the available genomes still fail to capture much of the substantial genetic diversity within the Drosophila genus. We have therefore tested protocols to rapidly and inexpensively sequence and assemble the genome from any Drosophila species using single-molecule sequencing technology from Oxford Nanopore. Here, we use this technology to present highly contiguous genome assemblies of 15 Drosophila species: 10 of the 12 originally sequenced Drosophila species (ananassae, erecta, mojavensis, persimilis, pseudoobscura, sechellia, simulans, virilis, willistoni, and yakuba), four additional species that had previously reported assemblies (biarmipes, bipectinata, eugracilis, and mauritiana), and one novel assembly (triauraria). Genomes were generated from an average of 29x depth-of-coverage data that after assembly resulted in an average contig N50 of 4.4 Mb. Subsequent alignment of contigs from the published reference genomes demonstrates that our assemblies could be used to close over 60\% of the gaps present in the currently published reference genomes.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic {DNA} is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags ({ESTs}) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes.
{RESULTS}: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder {AUGUSTUS}. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using {TransMap}, evolutionary conservation of {DNA}, {mRNA} and {ESTs} of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only {ESTs} we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57\% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human {mRNAs}, this number rises to 77\%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available. Native {cDNA} evidence is most helpful when the alignments are used as compound information rather than independent positionwise information.
{AVAILABILITY}: {AUGUSTUS} is open source and available at http://augustus.gobics.de. The gene predictions for human can be browsed and downloaded at the {UCSC} Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu).},

Here, we use Drosophila suzukii as a model to highlight how populations from separate geographical regions differ in their genetic and phenotypic traits, including those associated with their invasiveness. New X-linked data indicate the presence of at most three D. suzukii genetic clusters in Europe, while North American populations are characterised by a larger genetic diversity. We found a likely new colonisation event from America to Italy and demonstrate that reference genomes from Italian and Californian populations lay in highly distant clusters. Comparative genomics indicate that these two genomes bear the traces of distinct evolutionary forces and are genetically distant, having diversified long ago in their native Asian range. Phenotypic studies further indicate that European and North American populations have differences in hatch rate, generation time, and parasitoid susceptibility. The observed genotypic and phenotypic differences likely represent a small fraction of the features unique to each of the two populations. The results provide some new insights towards both fundamental and management studies on invasive pests, particularly when findings are transferred across populations found in different geographical regions.},

	abstract = {Transposable elements ({TEs}) are selfish {DNA} sequences that multiply within host genomes. They are present in most species investigated so far at varying degrees of abundance and sequence diversity. The {TE} composition may not only vary between but also within species and could have important biological implications. Variation in prevalence among populations may for example indicate a recent {TE} invasion, whereas sequence variation could indicate the presence of hyperactive or inactive forms. Gaining unbiased estimates of {TE} composition is thus vital for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of transposons. To this end, we developed {DeviaTE}, a tool to analyse and visualize {TE} abundance using Illumina or Sanger sequencing reads. Our tool requires sequencing reads of one or more samples (tissue, individual or population) and consensus sequences of {TEs}. It generates a table and a visual representation of {TE} composition. This allows for an intuitive assessment of coverage, sequence divergence, segregating {SNPs} and indels, as well as the presence of internal and terminal deletions. By contrasting the coverage between {TEs} and single copy genes, {DeviaTE} derives unbiased estimates of {TE} abundance. We show that naive approaches, which do not consider regions spanned by internal deletions, may substantially underestimate {TE} abundance. Using published data we demonstrate that {DeviaTE} can be used to study the {TE} composition within samples, identify clinal variation in {TEs}, compare {TE} diversity among species, and monitor {TE} invasions. Finally we present careful validations with publicly available and simulated data. {DeviaTE} is implemented in Python and distributed under the {GPLv}3 (https://github.com/W-L/{deviaTE}).},

Here, we review how our understanding of bird genomes has changed with the recent sequencing of more than 75 species from all major avian taxa. We illuminate avian genome evolution from a previously neglected perspective: their repetitive genomic parasites, transposable elements ({TEs}) and endogenous viral elements ({EVEs}). We show that (1) birds are unique among vertebrates in terms of their genome organization; (2) information about the diversity of avian {TEs} and {EVEs} is changing rapidly; (3) flying birds have smaller genomes yet more {TEs} than flightless birds; (4) current second-generation genome assemblies fail to capture the variation in avian chromosome number and genome size determined with cytogenetics; (5) the genomic microcosm of bird–{TE} “arms races” has yet to be explored; and (6) upcoming third-generation genome assemblies suggest that birds exhibit stability in gene-rich regions and instability in {TE}-rich regions. We emphasize that integration of cytogenetics and single-molecule technologies with repeat-resolved genome assemblies is essential for understanding the evolution of (bird) genomes.},

	abstract = {Microbial symbioses have evolved repeatedly across the tree of life, but the genetic changes underlying transitions to symbiosis are largely unknown, especially for eukaryotic microbial symbionts. We used the genus Amanita, an iconic group of mushroom-forming fungi engaged in ectomycorrhizal symbioses with plants, to identify both the origins and potential genetic changes maintaining the stability of this mutualism. A multi-gene phylogeny reveals one origin of the symbiosis within Amanita, with a single transition from saprotrophic decomposition of dead organic matter to biotrophic dependence on host plants for carbon. Associated with this transition are the losses of two cellulase genes, each of which plays a critical role in extracellular decomposition of organic matter. However a third gene, which acts at later stages in cellulose decomposition, is retained by many, but not all, ectomycorrhizal species. Experiments confirm that symbiotic Amanita species have lost the ability to grow on complex organic matter and have therefore lost the capacity to live in forest soils without carbon supplied by a host plant. Irreversible losses of decomposition pathways are likely to play key roles in the evolutionary stability of these ubiquitous mutualisms.},
